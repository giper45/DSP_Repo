{"description":"My first lab with my python chat.","goal":"<p>The goal is to start chatting.</p>","solution":"<p>First of all, if you don't have them yet, you have to download the following two images from my repository on docker hub with the \"docker pull\" command:</p>\n<p><code class=\"pt-2 ng-binding\">emalderson/my-first-repo:client_0.2</code></p>\n<p><code class=\"pt-2 ng-binding\">emalderson/my-first-repo:server_0.2</code></p>\n<p><code class=\"pt-2 ng-binding\"></code><code class=\"pt-2 ng-binding\"></code>Now start the lab and launch the terminal in both server and client. Then start the server on the server container with \"python3 serverExt.py\". After that you can start the client on the client container with \"python3 clientExt.py\".</p>\n<p>Once started, the client will prompt for an IP, so let's use the IP of the server, which is 193.20.1.2.</p>\n<p>Now have fun chatting using this awful chat!</p>","author":"gx1"}
